All contributions to any component of the Synse platform are greatly appreciated! There
are numerous ways which you can contribute:

## Reporting an Issue

If you find a bug, experience unexpected behavior, or just can't get something working,
open an issue on the project's GitHub page. We'll do our best to answer any questions
and fix bugs.

## Requesting a Feature

If there is missing functionality in a component that you think would be nice to have and
improve the project, open a feature request issue on the project's GitHub page. We will discuss
and try to roll the feature(s) into the project's development timeline.

## Fixing Bugs and Adding Features

If simply reporting a bug or requesting a feature is not enough and you want to get your
hands dirty, you can contribute directly to a project's code base. The contributor workflow
follows standard practice:

- Open an issue describing the work (this helps for tracking project development)
- Fork the repo you wish to work on
- Add your commits
- Open a pull request
- Discuss and review the code
