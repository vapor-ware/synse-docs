hero: Plugin Application Metrics
---

A plugin can be configured to expose application metrics via its [plugin configuration](../configuration/plugin.md#configuration-options).
When enabled, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics are exposed on port `2112` for
the application at the `/metrics` endpoint.
