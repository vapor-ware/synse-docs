## Getting

## Configuring

A plugin built with the SDK can take two different types of configuration: 

1. [**Plugin Configuration**](configuration.plugin.md): This is the configuration for the plugin itself,
   defining how it should behave at runtime.
2. [**Device Configuration**](configuration.device.md): This is the configuration which tells the plugin
   about the devices that it manages. 

View the configuration pages, linked above, for more details.
